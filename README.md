# Pewlett Hackard:

## Employee Database Analysis

### Overview of the Analysis:

The purpose of the analysis is to determine the number of current employees eligible for retirement to help the business strategically plan for the future. 

In addition, given the substantial number of employees that are eligible for retirement in the Sales and Development departments, the managers would like to try a new mentoring program for employees getting ready to retire.  Instead of having a large number of their employees retire completely, they would like to introduce a mentoring program that would allow experienced and successful employees to step back into a part-time role.  In the new part-time role, the tenured employees would mentor newly hired associates.

Finally, a couple of examples of reports created to help manager’s proactively make decisions and plan for the future are:

-	A report with a list of titles of the retirement eligible employees named retiring_titles was created.
-	A report with a list of the current employees eligible to participate in a new mentorship program named mentorship_eligibility was created.


### Results: 

After reviewing the information in the reports created for this analysis, identified that:

-	30% of employees were eligible to retire which could significantly impact the business (Number of employees eligible for retirement of 72,458 / current number of employees of 240,124 = 30.2%).  

This graph provides additional information related to the titles of the retirement eligible employees:

-	70% of the retirement eligible employees have senior titles (50,842 # of senior titles / 72,458 # of retirement eligible employees = 70.2%). 

-	67% of the retirement eligible employees are in the Development, Production, and Sales departments (19,391 Development employees + 17,784 Production employees + 11,503 Sales employees / 72,458 retirement eligible employee population = 67.2%).  See chart below for additional information.

-	There are 1,549 (2%) retirement eligible employees eligible for the new mentorship program proposed by the managers of the Development and Sales departments.

### Summary:

After reviewing the data, it is easy to see there is a large number of employees, especially senior employees, who are or will shortly be eligible for retirement.  In order for the company to be in a position to continue to operate successfully it will require some strategic planning.  

We would like to provide answers to questions already asked by management as well as provide additional information we think might be helpful as you start to put mitigation plans in place:

- Q1. How many roles will need to be filled as the “silver tsunami” begins to make an impact?

- A1. A total of 72,458 employees eligible for retirement.

------------------------------------------------------------------

- Q2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlet Hackard employees?

- A2. No, based on the current proposed mentorship eligibility criteria there are only 1,549 retirement eligible employees that qualify, which is only 2% of the population.  

It might make sense to review the mentorship eligibility criteria and identify if there are any adjustments or additions that would increase the eligible participants.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional information that might be helpful to keep in mind as you work through a mitigation plan:

1.	Additional information has been provided showing the breakdown of retirement eligible employees by department use this to help assess needs.  

This graph provides additional information related to the number of retirement eligible employees per department:

------------------------------------------------------------------

 2.	Given the current low unemployment rate as well as the lack of availability to skilled employees, it might be difficult to find qualified candidates to fill open positions especially if there is a high attrition rate at one time.  Here are some proactive steps that can be taken now to help alleviate some of the pressure:

-	Review the current department activities to identify opportunities to streamline, reduce, or automate any of the work or processes.  

-	Review documentation to ensure processes are clearly documented so if someone else needs to complete the work they will have a guide to help them.

-	Identify employees looking for additional responsibilities or stretch assignments and have them cross-train with another employee.
-	Implement a program where the tenured (non-retirement eligible) staff mentor employees that are newer to the department.

------------------------------------------------------------------

3.	Identify critical employees and work:

-	Determine if there is more than one employee to cover the work or if there is a gap.

-	Identify an incentive program to entice retirement eligible employees to continue working full-time and post-pone retirement.

I believe implementing these recommendations will help reduce the impact of the “silver tsunami” and allow the company to continue to be successful.
